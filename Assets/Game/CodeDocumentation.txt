The main game logic is -- 

First cards distribution script is called. It distributes 52 cards to equally b/w player and bot ! 
Every distribution is random. The cards are stored in a list in a form of scriptable object.

Thus there are 2 lists of cards. One for player and one for bot.
Then player will play the card and after that bot will play the card.
If player wins then player gets extra chance to play the card. If bot wins then bot gets extra chance to play the card. 

I used coroutines for card movement 

Card will first move and rotate to location 1 then location2 the code is in GameManager and Enemy script 

When one of the list is empty then the game is over and the winner is declared.
